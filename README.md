This repository is intended solely for domain ownership verification purposes.<br>
It contains no active code or projects. Its only function is to verify the ownership of the "zaorinu" domain with external platforms.

Some of my official social media accounts have the <[zaorinu.github.io](https://zaorinu.github.io)> domain verified.<br>
If a profile claiming to represent me does not have this verification, please be cautious, as it may be fraudulent.
